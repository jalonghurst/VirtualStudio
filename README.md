## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node.js/Express.js, EJS templating engine. 

A node.js/express.js app built on MVC architecture. Includes authentication using Passport. Images submitted by users are stored in Cloudinary with CloudinaryID, and all data handled using MongoDB atlas database /Mongoose.

  ## Optimizations
  
  Implementing the customizable Tailwind CSS component library daisyUI as well as the CSS framework Tailwind greatly simplified and streamlined my experience sytling the ejs pages within the app. 


  Upcoming optimizations : 
  
  -GoogleAuth authentication option; this will simplify and speed up the sign up process for the user as well as ensure login email is valid and verified. 
  
  -Ability to toggle a light/dark theme, either saved in sessions or as a user preference. 
  
  -Adding pagination to page sections where multiple posts will be displayed - on the newsfeed and profile pages.
  
  -Ability to open a fullscreen view of an image on a post page. 
  
  -Ability for a user to bookmark any of their favourite posts, so that they can come back to view them later with no hassle.
